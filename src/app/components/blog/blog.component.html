	I build large scale applications primarily with Angular, in JavaScript, for desktop, tablet, mobile or server.
	Combined with a background in UX and design means I can take applications from conception to completion autonomously.
	I can also provide consulting and advice on solutions or design ideas.
	On the web, I work with both vanilla and framework-based applications with strong capabilities in popular frameworks
	such as Angular and React.
